I have validated the entire dataset. The following describes how each column was validated:\n\n- **week:**  There are **six weeks** in the data set, matching the number of weeks since the new product line was launched. There are no missing values in the week data set.No cleaning is needed.\n- **sales_method:** There are no missing values in the sales_method dataset. Validated by checking for character data type, same as the description. To clean, I converted all characters to lower case. I then converted \"em + call\" to \"email + call\" throughout the column. The dataset now has **three** sales methods **categories**: **\"email\"**, **\"call\"**, and **\"email + call\"**.\n`product_sales$sales_method <- tolower(product_sales$sales_method)`\n`product_sales$sales_method[product_sales$sales_method == \"em + call\"] <- 'email + call'`\n- **customer_id:** There are **15000 unique values** in the customer_id dataset. Validated by checking character type and unique rows. Data matches detail requirements. There are no missing values in the customer_id dataset. No cleaning is needed.\n- **nb_sold:** Validated by checking for numeric data type. The nb_sold data set has no missing values and matches the detail requirements. No cleaning is needed.\n- **revenue:** Validated by checking for numeric data type. There were **1074 missing values** in the revenue data set. This was cleaned by taking the mean of the revenue by nb_sold groups and applying the mean revenue of each nb_sold group to the appropriate missing values. I chose to apply the mean of each nb_sold group, rather than the entire data set, as the revenue was strongly correlated with increasing nb_sold values. I then rounded the dataset to two decimal places. There are now no missing values in the revenue data set.\n`product_sales <- product_sales %>%`\n`group_by(nb_sold) %>%`\n`mutate_at(vars(revenue), ~replace_na(., mean(., na.rm = TRUE)))`\n`product_sales$revenue <- round(product_sales$revenue, 2)`\n- **years_as_customer:** The years_as_customer data set was validated by checking for numeric datatype. I removed the two rows of data that exceeded the maximum years one could be a customer. The data set now contains only values from **0 to 39**. The entire data set now has **14998** rows.\n`product_sales <- product_sales %>% filter(years_as_customer < 40)`\n- **nb_site_visits:** The nb_site_visits data was validated by checking for numeric datatype. The nb_site_visits data set has no missing values and matches the detail requirements. No cleaning is needed.\n- **state:** The state data set was validated by checking for character datatype. The state data set has no missing values and matches the detail requirements as there are **50** different **states** represented in the dataset. No cleaning is needed.\n\nAfter data validation, the data set conatains **14998 rows and 8 columns** without missing values.","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"95998db1-6a96-4eaf-be86-7ad723ffd195"},{"source":"# How many customers were there for each approach?\nThere were three sales appoaches used for the product launch.
